.SYNOPSIS
    Launch FOFA scraper extension overnight in headful Chrome with CDP debugging.
    Starts the scan automatically — no manual popup clicking needed.

.DESCRIPTION
    1. Kills existing Chrome instances (saves session first)
    2. Launches Chrome with --remote-debugging-port=9222 + extension loaded
    3. Waits for Chrome to start
    4. Connects via CDP and triggers the scan by navigating to FOFA + injecting startScan

.NOTES
    Run this before sleeping. Monitor progress via:
      curl http://localhost:9222/json  (list Chrome tabs)
    Or check extension state from another PowerShell:
      Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:9222/json | Select url, title
