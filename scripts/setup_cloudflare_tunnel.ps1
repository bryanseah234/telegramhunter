.SYNOPSIS
    One-time Cloudflare Tunnel setup for theprawnhunter honeypot receiver.
    Binds winnethepooh.hong-yi.me → localhost:8011 (API + honeypot receiver).

.DESCRIPTION
    After running this script:
    1. A browser window opens for CF auth (one-time)
    2. A named tunnel "prawnhunter" is created
    3. DNS CNAME winnethepooh.hong-yi.me → <tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com is added
    4. A Windows service is registered so the tunnel persists across reboots

.NOTES
    Prerequisites:
    - cloudflared installed (winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared)
    - hong-yi.me domain on your Cloudflare account
    - Docker API running on localhost:8011
